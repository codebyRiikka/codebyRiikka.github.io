                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am 29-years-old career changer with a passion for technology, which led me to pursue a degree in Information and Communication Technology.
                        In addition to programming, I have studied the fundamentals of ICT and basic embedded systems, which I also find fascinating.<br><br>
                        Previously, I worked as a practical nurse in elderly care for seven years. However, I sought new challenges in my life and spent a long time 
                        searching for the right path. Now, I believe I have found a new direction for my career, and I am
                        very determinedly pursuing it.<br><br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy various forms of exercise, especially long-distance running and cycling.
                        Additionally, I love playing video games with my partner and spending time with our three cats ^^.

                    <h2>Education and Career</h2>
                    <p>I graduated from high school with satisfactory grades in 2015. Due to a challenging life situation at the time, I didn't really have the opportunity
                        to think deeply about what I truly wanted for my future. <br><br> Having seen the work of practical nurses up close, I decided to pursue a degree in practical nursing, 
                        studying from 2015 to 2017. <br> For seven years, I worked in assisted living facilities for the elderly.
                        In the fall of 2023, I began my current studies in Kainuu Vocational College, aiming to graduate in the spring of 2025.

                <h3>Functional website template for escape room</h3>
                <p>I worked on this project with a schoolmate as our first "real" programming project for school.<br>
                    The idea was to create a web page template that could be used to add text and video materials for an escape room game. <br><br>
                    The web page template was intended to be a significant part of the escape room game, providing instructions and tasks for the puzzles. 
                    Once a player solved a puzzle, they would move on to the next one until all puzzles were solved and the game was completed.<br><br>
                    I also created a tools page through which the creator/admin of the escape room game can create a new escape room (materials) for the web page template,
                    edit an existing one, or delete an escape room.<br><br>
                    The project lasted approximately 6 weeks and was an intensive period. We used JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS for the project.

                <h3>Phonebook task in FS-course</h3>
                <p>In this task, the goal was to great a phonebook where the contact information is stored on a server. All new contacts are saved to the server. <br><br>
                    Other features include searching for a contact in the phonebook using a search field, updating existing contact information, and deleting a contact.<br><br><br>
                    Updated (28.8.24): Later on the FS-course there was a task, where you need to make own back-end for the phonebook. After the back-end was done, next mission was to make complete build from these front- & back-ends,<br>
                    and then upload the fullstack -versio to internet by using Render.<br><br>
                    Updated (4.9.24): The final task in this assignment was to modify the backend so that all phone contacts is retrieved from the MongoDB database, and likewise, new data is stored there, and aditing the data is also possible.<br>
                    At this point, the app is not for private use, so everyone can add contact info, which will be visible and editable to everyone. In the future, the app could be developed for private use.<br><br>
                    HTML, CSS, React, JS, Node.js and MongoDB used in this task.<br><br>

                <h3>Information of Countries-task in FS-course</h3>
                <p>In this task, the goal was to utilize the https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/ service, which provides information about countries in a machine-readable format (REST API).<br><br>
                    The task was to implement an application that retrieves data from this interface for the user. Features included filtering search results
                    using a search field, displaying up to 10 different countries at a time, and obtaining information about a specific country by clicking on it
                    or refining the search to a specific country. The information displayed includes the country's capital, population,spoken languages and
                    realtime weather report.<br><br>
                    HTML, CSS and React used in this task.<br><br>
