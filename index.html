                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am 28-years-old career changer with a passion for technology, which led me to pursue a degree in Information and Communication Technology.
                        In addition to programming, I have studied the fundamentals of ICT and basic embedded systems, which I also find fascinating.<br><br>
                        Previously, I worked as a practical nurse in elderly care for seven years. However, I sought new challenges in my life and spent a long time 
                        searching for the right path. Now, I believe I have found a new direction for my career, and I am
                        very determinedly pursuing it.<br><br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy various forms of exercise, especially long-distance running and cycling.
                        Additionally, I love playing video games with my partner and spending time with our three cats ^^.

                    <h2>Education and Career</h2>
                    <p>I graduated from high school with satisfactory grades in 2015. Due to a challenging life situation at the time, I didn't really have the opportunity
                        to think deeply about what I truly wanted for my future. <br><br> Having seen the work of practical nurses up close, I decided to pursue a degree in practical nursing, 
                        studying from 2015 to 2017. <br> For seven years, I worked in assisted living facilities for the elderly.
                        In the fall of 2023, I began my current studies in Kainuu Vocational College, aiming to graduate in the spring of 2025.

                <h3>Functional website template for escape room</h3>
                <p>I worked on this project with a schoolmate as our first "real" programming project for school.<br>
                    The idea was to create a web page template that could be used to add text and video materials for an escape room game. <br><br>
                    The web page template was intended to be a significant part of the escape room game, providing instructions and tasks for the puzzles. 
                    Once a player solved a puzzle, they would move on to the next one until all puzzles were solved and the game was completed.<br><br>
                    I also created a tools page through which the creator/admin of the escape room game can create a new escape room (materials) for the web page template,
                    edit an existing one, or delete an escape room.<br><br>
                    The project lasted approximately 6 weeks and was an intensive period. We used JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS for the project.

                <p>In this task, the goal was to great a phonebook where the contact information is stored on a server. All new contacts are saved to the server. <br><br>
                    Other features include searching for a contact in the phonebook using a search field, updating existing contact information, and deleting a contact.<br><br>

                <p>In this task, the goal was to utilize the https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/ service, which provides information about countries in a machine-readable format (REST API).<br><br>
                    The task was to implement an application that retrieves data from this interface for the user. Features included filtering search results
                    using a search field, displaying up to 10 different countries at a time, and obtaining information about a specific country by clicking on it
                    or refining the search to a specific country. The information displayed includes the country's capital, population,spoken languages and
                    realtime weather report.<br><br>
